# Get Started

To get started, it is important you get the philosophy of Guyn Style. Guyn Style is not a Sass Library which gives you styling or ready made components. Guyn Style just gives you the tools to build this, a grid, many functions and mixins and a solid base to set up your project.

We believe any project is and should be identical, so we don't provide you with any styling. Also CSS is fun, so why should we take the styling from you? We just give you a good set of tools to make it even more fun.
